                    pictures.
                    However, more than anything else, they are made of words. Oh so many words. As we equip teams to
                    design
                    and
                    code usable, consistent, beautiful interfaces using systems, it's essential that words depend on a
                    strong
                    foundation of typography.

                    I'll admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design degree. I'm never the person
                    choosing
                    a
                    font, scaling type, or finessing letter spacing. As a result, I've always been reluctant to write
                    about
                    typography.

                    On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years, I've contributed to many design systems
                    that
                    set a
                    foundation for typography. Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a foundation and apply it to
                    an
                    emerging library of interface components. This article summarizes those patterns.

                <div id="p4">
                    Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families and weights along with fallbacks. It then
                    explores how to build hierarchy using size, color, additional details like line-height, and layering
                    responsiveness. Those models are then applied to components in a system's library (like Article and
                    Header)
                    as well as custom components made by other teams.
